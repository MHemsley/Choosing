# Choosing

## Original team
This project was produced as part of a UCL project for the CS conversion course. The original project team who created the app up until the initital commit are @ioannakok... 

## Purpose
The purpose of this application was to provide a user friendly version of the information that can be found within the Choosing (what's best for you) booklets originally produced by the EBPU [add in partners]. The aim of the booklet (and of this project) is to provide young people with information on the effectiveness of evidence based therapies (building on the work within what works for whom).

## Tech stack
The application was built with Ionic 1, and will subsequently moved to Ionic 2, to increase the ability to produce a progressive web application from the same codebase
